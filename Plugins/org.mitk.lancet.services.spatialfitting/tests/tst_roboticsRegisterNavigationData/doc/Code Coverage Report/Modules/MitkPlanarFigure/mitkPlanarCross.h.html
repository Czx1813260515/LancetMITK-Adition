  /**
   * \brief Implementation of PlanarFigure modeling a cross with two orthogonal lines
   * on a plane.
   *
   * The cross consists of two two orthogonal lines, which are defined by four control points
   * lying on a plane. The two control points of the first line are freely placable within
   * the bounds of the underlying 2D geometry, while the two control points of the second line
   * are ensured to meet the following constraints:
   *
   * 1.) The lines must be orthogonal to each other
   * 2.) The second line must lie within the 2D area defined by the first line
   * 3.) The two lines must intersect (at least with their boundaries)
   *
   * When placing the second line interactively, a graphical helper polyline is provided to the
   * user to indicate the position and orthogonal orientation of the line if it would be placed
   * at the current mouse position.
   *
   * When modifying one of the lines by interactively moving its control points, the respective
   * other line is deleted and the user is prompted to draw it again.
   *
   * The class provide a special mode for drawing single lines (SingleLineModeOn/Off); in this
   * case, interaction stops after the first line has been placed.
   *
   * The class provides the lengths of both lines via the "feature" interface, ordered by size.
